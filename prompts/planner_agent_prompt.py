PLANNER_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''
You are a planner agent. Plan the narrative or design characters and world settings using the following principles:

1. Each character must feel like a person, not just a narrative tool. What do they want? What are they afraid of? What are they hiding?
2. Give characters flaws or limitations that lead to mistakes or conflict. Avoid overly ideal or perfectly wise personalities.
3. Define a visible emotional arc or potential for change over time, even if it hasn't occurred yet.
4. Avoid passive or purely supportive roles. Each character should have a goal, opinion, or tension that might cause friction.
5. Any special traits (e.g., being a ghost, AI, alien) must shape how the character interacts with the world. The story should not work the same without this trait.
6. Give each character a life beyond the protagonist. Ask: What is their history? What relationships do they have outside the main plot? What unfinished business or personal motive drives them?
7. Avoid clichÃ©s unless they are subverted or presented with a twist. Make the first impression unpredictable, intriguing, or ambiguous.
'''

INIT_SETUP_RULES_TEMPLETE = """
1. Keep Types "character," "place," and "item" fixed. Additional entity types may be introduced only if necessary.
2. Set up more than three characters, including at least one protagonist, one antagonist, and one side character, if possible.
3. Select unique and distinctive proper nouns for naming entities to enhance clarity and uniqueness. Prefer concise, single-word names to make extraction easier. Avoid alias-based names.
4. Clearly annotate each entity with concise, descriptive comments upon declaration.
5. Incorporate all elements listed under **Story Prompt** into the "Entities" and "Initial State."
6. Ensure all narrative goals mentioned in the **Story Prompt** are included in the "utility(narrative)." This includes every major plot point and the ending, if they are described in the **Story Prompt**.
7. It is mandatory that every character has a utility function declared. The argument name must exactly match the character's name. Do not omit any character.
8. Character utilities must be grounded entirely in the characters' own motivations, objectives, and viewpoints. They should not contain any narrative-level objectives.

PART1_DESCRIPTION = """
## PART 1: Setup (0~25% of the story)
This stage introduces your protagonist and teases the reader with elements of tension and conflict that will unfold later. By the end of PART 1, the reader should clearly sense that a significant event (the first plot point) is about to alter the protagonist's life profoundly.

## Essential narrative goals of PART 1
1. Create a Hook: Within the first 5-12.5% of the story, you must hook readers' curiosity and interest. e.g., From The Da Vinci Code: A man found dead in the Louvre, having left a cryptic message written with his own blood.
2. Introduce the Protagonist: Clearly present your protagonist's background, personal desires, internal struggles, and any relevant past events. e.g., From The Da Vinci Code: Introducing Robert Langdon, a professor and symbologist drawn into solving a murder mystery.
3. Establish the Stakes and Danger: Introduce or hint at potential threats, conflicts, or obstacles the protagonist will face. Keep it subtle; do not fully reveal the depth or scope of these dangers yet. e.g., From The Da Vinci Code: Langdon is falsely accused of murder and must escape authorities while uncovering deeper conspiracies threatening his life and reputation.
4. Foreshadow Upcoming Events: Provide subtle clues or hints indicating significant changes or dramatic events on the horizon. These hints should build anticipation without explicitly revealing the plot twists. e.g., A husband leaves home without noticing his forgotten shopping list, while his wife, drinking heavily at home, signals future conflicts indirectly. These seemingly minor events foreshadow a major turning point later.
5. End PART 1 with the First Plot Point: Conclude this section with a pivotal event that drastically changes the protagonist's circumstances, goals, or perspective. This event marks the beginning of the main narrative and clearly defines the story's central conflict.
""".strip()

PART2_DESCRIPTION = """
## PART 2: Reaction (25~50% of the story)
This stage illustrates your protagonist's reaction to the dramatic new circumstances or conflicts introduced at the end of PART 1. Show how your protagonist initially reacts to the threats or challenges they face-through hesitation, denial, escape, or ineffective attempts at resolution. PART 2 ends with your protagonist experiencing a significant realization or revelation (the Midpoint), prompting a critical change in their approach.

## Essential narrative goals of PART 2
1. Depict Immediate Reaction: Clearly demonstrate your protagonist's authentic emotional and practical reactions to the new conflict or danger. e.g., A protagonist fleeing law enforcement without understanding why they're being chased, focusing purely on survival instincts.
2. Establish Empathy through Struggle: Develop empathy by portraying the protagonist's vulnerability, uncertainty, and inner conflict, making the reader deeply understand their perspective and choices.
3. Sequence of Progressive Attempts and Failures: Include a structured sequence of scenes showcasing the protagonist: Retreating to regroup and assess the situation, Making ineffective or misguided attempts at addressing the conflict, and Facing a stark reminder of the antagonist's power or threat (1st Pinch Point).
4. Clearly Illustrate the 1st Pinch Point: Provide a direct and impactful demonstration of the antagonist's threat or power without filtering through the protagonist's perspective. e.g., The antagonist ruthlessly eliminates an ally, reinforcing the danger and stakes of the conflict.
5. Lead up to a Transformative Midpoint Revelation: Conclude PART 2 by positioning your protagonist for a critical realization or discovery (Midpoint) that radically changes their perspective, shifting them from reactive to proactive. e.g., The protagonist learns a hidden truth about their enemy or themselves, prompting a decisive new strategy for the second half of the story.
""".strip()

PART3_DESCRIPTION = """
## PART 3: Attack (50~75% of the story)
This stage demonstrates a decisive shift in your protagonist from reaction to action. Empowered by the midpoint revelation, the protagonist now proactively tackles the core conflict, demonstrating courage, ingenuity, and determination. Obstacles are faced head-on, and the protagonist evolves, confronting both external and internal challenges. PART 3 culminates with the second plot point, introducing the final critical information needed to propel the narrative toward its resolution.

## Essential narrative goals of PART 3
1. Show the Protagonist Taking Initiative: Clearly illustrate the protagonist's proactive engagement with obstacles, using creative problem-solving and newfound courage to confront the antagonist directly. e.g., A protagonist devises a strategic plan to confront and expose their enemy, actively moving towards resolution instead of avoiding conflict.
2. Depict Clear Character Growth: Highlight significant personal evolution, demonstrating how the protagonist's internal strengths and capabilities have developed as they embrace the role of a hero, actively addressing previously avoided fears or doubts.
3. Introduce the 2nd Pinch Point (Heightened Stakes): Showcase a powerful and intense demonstration of the antagonist's increased strength, compelling readers to feel the protagonist's struggle. The threat should be clearly felt through the protagonist's experience. e.g., The protagonist is nearly defeated in an intense battle, vividly conveying the antagonist's formidable power and heightening the story's tension.
4. Deepen Emotional and Physical Conflict: Intensify both internal and external conflicts, forcing the protagonist to confront their deepest fears, unresolved emotions, or moral dilemmas, pushing them toward emotional maturity.
5. Reveal the Critical Second Plot Point: End PART 3 by introducing one final, transformative piece of narrative information-essential for the protagonist's final approach to resolving the central conflict. e.g., The protagonist discovers a critical weakness in the antagonist or uncovers the true nature of their mission, significantly altering their approach and propelling the story towards its climax.

PART4_DESCRIPTION = """
## PART 4: Resolution (75~100% of the story)
In this final stage, your protagonist fully assumes their heroic role, actively resolving the central conflict, overcoming their inner struggles, and defeating the antagonist. No new narrative information should be introduced after the second plot point. PART 4 must highlight the protagonist's growth, courage, and agency, delivering a satisfying conclusion that emotionally resonates with readers.

## Essential narrative goals of PART 4
1. Showcase Protagonist's Ultimate Heroism: Emphasize the protagonist's direct and decisive action to overcome obstacles and defeat the antagonist. They must actively resolve the conflict rather than relying on external aid or coincidence. e.g., The protagonist courageously confronts the antagonist in a final, climactic showdown, leveraging skills and insights gained throughout the story.
2. Demonstrate Internal Transformation: Clearly illustrate how the protagonist has overcome their internal struggles or personal demons. Highlight emotional growth, maturity, or realization that enables them to achieve their ultimate goal.
3. Resolve Central Conflicts and Subplots: Provide clear resolutions to the major conflicts and significant subplots raised throughout the narrative, ensuring readers feel satisfied and rewarded for their emotional investment.
4. Avoid New Narrative Information: Ensure no new explanatory or critical narrative information is introduced post-second plot point. All key knowledge required for resolution should already be established earlier.
5. Deliver a Powerful and Emotional Ending: Aim for a compelling conclusion that evokes strong emotional responses-such as joy, sadness, relief, or catharsisâleaving readers with a profound sense of completion or inspiration. e.g., The protagonist's final victory significantly impacts their world, evoking pride, hope, or bittersweet reflection from readers.

Deliver a Powerful and Emotional Ending: Aim for a compelling conclusion that evokes strong emotional responses-such as joy, sadness, relief, or catharsisâleaving readers with a profound sense of completion or inspiration. e.g., The protagonist's final victory significantly impacts their world, evoking pride, hope, or bittersweet reflection from readers.
