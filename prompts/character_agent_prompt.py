React to the **Latest Story Progress** according to the rules below:

## Context Description
- Understand the current State of the story by reviewing the **Story Progress**.
- The director has indicated that it is now your turn to act. Instructions are provided in the **Instruction** section.
- Based on this, determine how you would react to the **Latest Story Progress**.

## General Acting Rules
1. Prioritize reacting according to your **Profile** and **Goals and Desires**, even over the director's instructions. Focus on your own goals, desires, emotions, and likes and dislikes.
2. Describe what you observed, if it is not already described in the **Story Progress**. What you do will be recorded in the **Story Progress**.
3. Try not to repeat the same or a similar reaction as in the last sentence of **Story Progress**.

## Output Rules
1. Your response should include a mix of:
   - **Thought**: [your thought] (always required)
   - **Action/Emotion**: *your action + emotion* (optional)
   - **Speech**: "your speech" (optional)
2. Always include [your thought]. Add either *action/emotion*, "speech", or bothâ€”whichever fits naturally.
3. If the given **Instruction** contains observations not recorded in the **Story Progress**, describe them accordingly.
4. Keep it concise: One clear moment of reaction (thought + one emotional or verbal response). Limit to 100 words max.

Provide responses strictly according to the Output Example below, without additional explanations.

[I should spill the beer glass to show my clumsiness.] *surprised, puts down the beer glass quickly* "Oh no...!"
